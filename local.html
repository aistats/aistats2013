    AISTATS 2011 will be held in <a href="http://www.sunny.org">Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA</a>, on the Atlantic coast of Florida.&nbsp; The conference hotel is close to two major airports: Miami (MIA, about 30 miles away) and Ft. Lauderdale (FLL, about 5 miles away, or 10 minutes by taxi).&nbsp; Both MIA and FLL have nonstop flights from a number of U.S. and European airports, although MIA is larger and better connected than FLL.<p>

    The conference hotel is on the intracoastal waterway, which runs along the coast inside a series of barrier islands; a water taxi service connects the hotel via the intracostal waterway to various destinations in Ft. Lauderdale.&nbsp; There are also a number of restaurants in easy walking distance on the hotel grounds.<p>

    The hotel will provide free internet access to conference attendees, and also runs a complimentary shuttle to the nearby public beach.&nbsp; The hotel does not have a shuttle to MIA or FLL; they recommend a taxi from FLL.<p>
