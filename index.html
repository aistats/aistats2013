	 <p>The Sixteenth international conference on Artificial
    Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2013) will be held in Scottsdale, AZ, USA.&nbsp; AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of
    researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.&nbsp; Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them.&nbsp; We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective.</p>
