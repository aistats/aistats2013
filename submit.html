	<h2>Instructions for submitting camera-ready papers</h2>

	The
	deadline for uploading camera-ready versions is <b>April 10, 2013 at
	11:59PM UTC</b>.

	<p>
	Camera-ready papers should use the updated AISTATS format.&nbsp Formatting information
	(including LaTeX style files) is
	<a id="styles" href="format2013_camera.zip">here</a>.
	Please do not modify the layout given by the style file. If you have questions about the style file
	or its usage, please contact the publications chair,
	<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Emdudik/">Miroslav Dud&iacute;k</a>.

	<p>
	In the CMT <a
	href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2013/Protected/Author/">Author
	Console</a>, there is now a new column labeled &ldquo;Camera
	Ready,&rdquo; and in this column, for each accepted paper, a link
	labeled &ldquo;Edit.&rdquo; Use this link to submit camera-ready papers.
	The CMT form will ask you for
	the list of authors, the title, the abstract, and the following files
	(where 171 is to be replaced by your paper ID):
	<pre>
	171.pdf
	171-supp.xxx    (optional)
	</pre>
	If a supplementary file is included, its type xxx can be pdf, zip, tgz
	or gz. In addition, you will be asked to provide submission code obtained
	by an automated style checker and confirm that you agree with having
	your work published in the proceedings.
	<ol>
	<li>
	Please ensure that the submitted title and abstract match the
	ones in the camera-ready version, and do not include any LaTeX commands or
	other non-human-readable markup.

	</li><li>							
	Please ensure that the submitted list of authors and the ordering
	among them matches the camera-ready version.

	</li><li>
	In preparing the camera-ready version, we request that you take
	into account reviewer and meta-reviewer feedback.
	Your camera-ready submission should be named 171.pdf (with 171
	replaced by your paper ID).  We only accept pdf
	files.  Please ensure that your camera-ready submission contains
	author information (instead of &ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; as
	was required for the original submission), and that you use the
	standard style as provided above.
	See detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready paper in
	Section 3 of the file sample2e.pdf, included with the style files.

	</li><li>
	Please verify that your paper follows the style requirements by
	submitting your pdf file to the
	<a 
	href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/pub/AISTATS2013/">
	style checking script</a>. You will need to provide the paper ID,
	your name (just one author), your e-mail and the pdf file. If the paper passes
	the style checks, you will obtain a submission code. (Please
	ignore the warnings of the style checker.) The CMT form
	will ask you to provide this submission code.

	</li><li>
	The camera-ready version will appear in the proceedings, published by JMLR
	W&amp;CP.&nbsp; The CMT will ask you to agree to have your
	work published by JMLR according to the agreement outlined
	<a
	href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf">here</a>.
	You do not need to print out and submit this agreement, just make
	sure to check the appropriate box in the CMT form.

	</li><li>
	You may optionally submit supplementary material, e.g., detailed
	proofs, code, data, or slides.  Please submit these as
	171-supp.xxx (with 171 replaced by your paper ID and xxx
	replaced by the file type).
	If the supplementary material includes multiple files, please
	compress these into a single zip, tgz or gz file.

	</li><li>
	You may continue to edit your camera-ready
	submissions until the camera-ready deadline.
