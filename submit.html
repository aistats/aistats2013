	<h2>Instructions for submitting camera-ready papers</h2>

	The
	deadline for uploading camera-ready versions is <b>April 10, 2013 at
	11:59PM UTC</b>.

	<p>
	Camera-ready papers should use the updated AISTATS format.&nbsp Formatting information
	(including LaTeX style files) is
	<a id="styles" href="format2013_camera.zip">here</a>.
	Please do not modify the layout given by the style file. If you have questions about the style file
	or its usage, please contact the publications chair,
	<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Emdudik/">Miroslav Dud&iacute;k</a>.

	<p>
	In the CMT <a
	href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2013/Protected/Author/">Author
	Console</a>, there is now a new column labeled &ldquo;Camera
	Ready,&rdquo; and in this column, for each accepted paper, a link
	labeled &ldquo;Edit.&rdquo; Use this link to submit camera-ready papers.
	The CMT form will ask you for
	the list of authors, the title, the abstract, and the following files
	(where 171 is to be replaced by your paper ID):
	<pre>
	171.pdf
	171-supp.xxx    (optional)
	</pre>
	If a supplementary file is included, its type xxx can be pdf, zip, tgz
	or gz. In addition, you will be asked to provide submission code obtained
	by an automated style checker and confirm that you agree with having
	your work published in the proceedings.

	<p>
	1. Please ensure that the submitted title and abstract match the
	ones in the camera-ready version, and do not include any LaTeX commands or
	other non-human-readable markup.

	<p>							
	2. Please ensure that the submitted list of authors and the ordering
	among them matches the camera-ready version.

	<p>
	3. In preparing the camera-ready version, we request that you take
	into account reviewer and meta-reviewer feedback.
	Your camera-ready submission should be named 171.pdf (with 171
	replaced by your paper ID).  We only accept pdf
	files.  Please ensure that your camera-ready submission contains
	author information (instead of &ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; as
	was required for the original submission), and that you use the
	standard style as provided above.
	See detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready paper in
	Section 3 of the file sample2e.pdf, included with the style files.

	<p>
	4. Please verify that your paper follows the style requirements by
	submitting your pdf file to the
	<a 
	href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/pub/AISTATS2013/">
	style checking script</a>. You will need to provide the paper ID,
	your name (just one author), your e-mail and the pdf file. If the paper passes
	the style checks, you will obtain a submission code. (Please
	ignore the warnings of the style checker.) The CMT form
	will ask you to provide this submission code.

	<p>
	5. The camera-ready version will appear in the proceedings, published by JMLR
	W&amp;CP.&nbsp; The CMT will ask you to agree to have your
	work published by JMLR according to the agreement outlined
	<a
	href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf">here</a>.
	You do not need to print out and submit this agreement, just make
	sure to check the appropriate box in the CMT form.

	<p>
	6. You may optionally submit supplementary material, e.g., detailed
	proofs, code, data, or slides.  Please submit these as
	171-supp.xxx (with 171 replaced by your paper ID and xxx
	replaced by the file type).
	If the supplementary material includes multiple files, please
	compress these into a single zip, tgz or gz file.

	<p>
	7. You may continue to edit your camera-ready
	submissions until the camera-ready deadline.

<h2>Instructions for submitting camera-ready papers and revised drafts</h2>

In the CMT <a
href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AIS2011/Protected/Author/">Author
Console</a>, there is now a new column labeled &ldquo;Camera
Ready,&rdquo; and in this column, for each accepted paper, a link
labeled &ldquo;Edit.&rdquo; You can use this link to submit both
camera-ready papers and revised drafts.  The CMT form will ask you for
the list of authors, the title, the abstract, and the following files
(where 171 is to be replaced by your paper ID):
<pre>
171_final.pdf
171_release.pdf
171_draft.pdf            (optional but recommended)
171_supplementary.xxx    (optional)
</pre>
If a supplementary file is included, its type xxx can be pdf, zip, tgz
or gz.  You may omit the 171_draft.pdf file if you submit the
171_final.pdf file before the draft proceedings deadline.

<p>
1. Please ensure that the submitted title and abstract match the
ones in the final paper, and do not include any LaTeX commands or
other non-human-readable markup.

<p>							
2. Please ensure that the submitted list of authors and the ordering
among them matches the final paper.

<p>
3. Your final submission should be named 171_final.pdf (with 171
replaced by your paper ID).  We only accept pdf
files.  Please ensure that your camera-ready submission contains
author information (instead of &ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; as
was required for the original submission), and that you use the
standard style as provided above. 
See detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready paper in
section 3 of the file sample2e.pdf, included with the style files.

<p>
4. The final version will appear in the proceedings, published by JMLR
W&amp;CP.&nbsp; JMLR requires a copyright release form, which you can
download 
<a
href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf">here</a>. 
Please print it out, fill it out, sign it, scan it, and submit it with
the final version as 171_release.pdf (with 171 replaced by your paper ID).

<p>
5. If you wish to have a draft version of your paper included in the
draft proceedings, 
upload it as 171_draft.pdf (with 171 replaced by your paper
ID) before the draft proceedings deadline. Follow the same formatting
instructions as for the camera-ready version.  If the camera-ready
version is uploaded before the draft proceedings deadline, we will use
it for the draft proceedings, and ignore any draft version; in this
case you do not need to submit a draft version.<p>

6. The draft version may be simply the submission file with
&ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; replaced by the actual author
information.  For the camera-ready version, we request that you take
into account reviewer and meta-reviewer feedback, as well as anything
you learn while presenting your paper at the conference.

<p>
7. You may optionally submit supplementary material, e.g., detailed
proofs, code, data, or slides.  Please submit these as
171_supplementary.xxx (with 171 replaced by your paper ID and xxx
replaced by the file type).
If the supplementary material includes multiple files, please
compress these into a single zip, tgz or gz file.

<p> 
8. You may continue to edit your draft and camera-ready
submissions until the camera-ready deadline.  Please be aware, though,
that edits to the draft version made after the draft proceedings
deadline may have no effect.

<h2>Submission of author feedback revisions of papers and supplementary material</h2>

Since CMT doesn't have direct support for uploading revisions, we asked authors
to upload revised papers to the <b>supplementary material
link</b>.&nbsp; As stated on the <a href="dates.php">Key Dates</a>
page, the deadline for uploading revised papers was <b>January 10, 2011
at 11:59PM UTC</b>.<p>

Your submission will <b>overwrite</b> your current supplementary materials, if any.&nbsp;  So, if you would like the reviewers to continue to be able to see your original supplementary material file, please include it, along with your revised paper, in a zip file, and upload the combined zip file to the supplementary material link.  You are also free to revise your supplementary material if desired.  In either case, please name your paper something like &ldquo;revised_paper_###.pdf&rdquo; (replacing ### with your paper ID) and put it at the top level of the zip file. (If you do not have supplementary material, you can just upload your revised paper as a pdf file to the supplementary material link; there is no need to wrap it in a zip file in this case.)&nbsp; You may also include supplementary material such as proofs at the end of your submission file in an appendix, so long as it is clearly labeled.&nbsp; Submissions are limited to 8 pages, <i>excluding</i> references and supplementary material.<p>

<h2>Submission of original papers and supplementary material</h2>

You may also include supplementary material such as proofs at the end of your submission file in an appendix, so long as it is clearly labeled.&nbsp; Submissions are limited to 8 pages, <i>excluding</i> references and supplementary material.<p>

Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is <a href="format/format.zip">here</a>.

    The AISTATS review process is double-blind.&nbsp; Please remove all identifying information from your submission, including author names, affiliations, and any acknowledgments.&nbsp; Self-citations can present a special problem: we recommend leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or otherwise well-known work, since the absence of such citations can be a red flag for reviewers.&nbsp; For unpublished or less-well-known work, or for large numbers of self-citations, it is up to the author's discretion how best to preserve anonymity.&nbsp; Possibilities include leaving out a citation altogether, including it but replacing the citation text with &ldquo;removed for anonymous submission,&rdquo; or leaving the citation as-is; authors should choose for each citation the treatment which is least likely to reveal authorship.<p>

Previous tech-report or workshop versions of a paper can similarly present a problem for anonymization.&nbsp; We suggest <i>leaving out</i> any identifying information for such versions, but bringing them to the attention of the program committee via the submission page.&nbsp; Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports (including reports on sites such as <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>) and papers in workshops without archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.&nbsp;
