<h2>Notable Paper Awards</h2>

Congratulations to our Notable Papers!&nbsp; We selected these 7 papers from over 270 submissions based on technical contribution, presentation, and overall significance.&nbsp; For each Notable Paper, the senior program commitee nominated a discussant; these discussants each wrote a short discussion paper summarizing the Notable Paper's most significant benefits, caveats, and relationships to the broader literature.<p>

We presented awards to the Notable Paper authors at the conference.&nbsp; Thanks to our <a href="sponsors.php">sponsors</a>, Google and Microsoft, for funding these awards!<p>
